        "description": "This program captures a highly biosynthetic / proliferative epithelial state, typical of intestinal transit-amplifying (TA) cells that are actively producing ribosomes and metabolic enzymes while having shut down the mucin/secretory gene set characteristic of differentiated goblet or surface mucous cells. Evidence: \u2022 Strong positive enrichment for ribosomal small and large-subunit genes (e.g. RPL3, RPLP0, RPS6, RPS18), translation factors (EEF1A1, EEF1B2, EEF1D), and mitochondrial electron-transport components (UQCRH, COX7C, NDUFA4) indicates high global protein-synthesis and energy demand typical of cycling/TA cells. \u2022 Additional proliferation-linked or housekeeping genes (TMSB10, PFN1, GAPDH, FTH1/FTL) further mark a metabolically active, undifferentiated epithelial population. \u2022 Genes that define mature secretory intestinal epithelium are negatively loaded: mucins (MUC1, MUC2, MUC13), trefoil factor TFF1, goblet markers ZG16, FCGBP, LYPD8, and CEACAM5. Their repression is expected in TA cells that have not yet adopted secretory lineage programs. \u2022 Negative loading of immune-presentation genes (B2M, HLA-E) and interferon-stimulated genes (IFI27, ISG15) is consistent with early epithelial progenitors, which express lower MHC class I and ISG levels than differentiated cells. Inconsistencies: \u2022 The module lacks classical intestinal stem-cell markers such as LGR5 or ASCL2, suggesting it reflects the immediate proliferative progeny (TA cells) rather than true stem cells. \u2022 The ribosome/translation signature is not unique to intestinal epithelium and can appear in any highly proliferative cell type; additional lineage markers outside this module would be needed for unambiguous tissue assignment.",

        "description": "This program reflects a \u201chigh translation / ribosome-biogenesis\u201d state seen in rapidly growing, metabolically active but non-stressed cells. Nearly every positively loaded gene encodes a cytosolic ribosomal protein or a core translation factor, while mitochondrial oxidative-phosphorylation transcripts are inversely correlated, indicating that cells scoring high for this program allocate resources to cytoplasmic protein synthesis and display low mitochondrial RNA content typical of healthy, proliferative cells rather than stressed or dying ones. Evidence: \u2022 Ribosome/translation up-regulation \u2500 dense enrichment of cytosolic ribosomal protein genes (RPL10, RPS18, RPL13A, RPS6, RPL32, RPS14, RPL27A, RPLP0, etc.), together with EEF1A1 and RACK1, is the canonical signature of ribosome biogenesis and active mRNA translation. \u2022 Biosynthetic/activation co-factors \u2500 FAU (ubiquitin-like ribosomal fusion protein), TMSB4X (supports actin dynamics during growth), and MIF (chaperone/cytokine that stabilises p53 and supports cell survival) commonly rise in proliferating or recently activated cells. \u2022 Low mitochondrial transcript content \u2500 strong negative loadings for MT-ATP6, MT-CO2/3, MT-CYB, MT-ND1/3/4/5 and MT-ATP8 denote reduced proportion of mitochondrial RNA; this is characteristic of healthy, non-stressed cells and contrasts with the high mitochondrial read fraction often seen in apoptotic or energetically stressed cells. \u2022 JUND, a stress-responsive/AP-1 factor, is negatively loaded, further supporting a low-stress cellular context. Inconsistencies: \u2022 TMSB4X and MIF can also rise in immune activation or migration states, which are not specifically addressed by the rest of the gene set, but their presence does not conflict with a general high-translation program.",

Evidence: \u2022 Coordinated high expression of small and large ribosomal subunit genes (e.g., RPS6, RPS18, RPS27A, RPL5, RPL10, RPLP1) and the translation elongation factor EEF1A1 is a canonical signature of enhanced global translation and growth. \u2022 Presence of both RPL and RPS paralogs across nearly every ribosomal position (P, E, and exit sites) underscores a broad, not subtype-specific, activation of the ribosome biogenesis pathway. \u2022 Negative loading of VMP1, a gene required for autophagosome formation and ER\u2013autophagosome contact, aligns with the notion that autophagy is repressed when anabolic protein synthesis is prioritized.

        "description": "The program is best explained by epithelial stem/progenitor cells that are experiencing strong canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling and have switched on a characteristic negative-feedback module that tempers this pathway; this pattern is well described for intestinal crypt base columnar (LGR5\u207a) stem cells and for other Wnt-high epithelial progenitors. Evidence: \u2022 NOTUM, NKD1, APCDD1 \u2013 three well-validated direct Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target genes that encode extracellular or membrane Wnt antagonists and are highly expressed in Wnt-high intestinal stem cells, hair-follicle matrix cells and pericentral hepatocytes as part of an auto-regulatory feedback loop. \u2022 ATOH8 \u2013 bHLH transcription factor transcriptionally induced by Wnt signalling in the intestinal epithelium and reported to restrain proliferation and promote differentiation, fitting a feedback-control programme. \u2022 PTCH1 \u2013 Hedgehog receptor whose expression is up-regulated in cells that receive Hedgehog cues; Hedgehog\u2013Wnt cross-talk helps position Wnt-responsive stem cells in several epithelia, including the gut and skin, and PTCH1 frequently co-labels with Wnt feedback genes in these niches. Inconsistencies: \u2022 The list lacks classic proliferative stem-cell markers (e.g. LGR5, ASCL2, AXIN2); if those genes are absent from the wider dataset, the assignment to crypt stem cells would be less secure. \u2022 PTCH1 is a Hedgehog, not Wnt, component; its presence is compatible with niche stem cells but could also point to other Hedgehog-responsive cell types such as mesenchyme or neural progenitors.",

Evidence: \u2022 Strong positive loading of virtually every small- and large-subunit ribosomal protein gene (e.g., RPL10, RPL13A, RPS6, RPS18) plus translation factors EEF1A1, RACK1/GNB2L1, FAU, NACA and TMSB4X \u2192 hallmark of active ribosome production and high translational throughput. \u2022 Negative loading of multiple mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS genes (MT-ATP6, MT-CO2/3, MT-CYB, MT-ND3/4L/5, MT-ATP8) \u2192 relative reduction in oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, consistent with a metabolic shift often accompanying rapid growth. Inconsistencies: \u2022 Down-weighted CD81 (tetraspanin) and JUND (AP-1 transcription factor) are not directly related to mitochondrial function; their negative association may reflect lineage-specific regulation rather than the core translation/mitochondrial antagonism captured by the program.",

The program couples strong extracellular-matrix (ECM) synthesis and remodeling with induction of smooth-muscle\u2013like contractile machinery and pericyte markers. Evidence: \u2022 ECM production: high expression of fibrillar collagens (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1/2, COL6A1-3, COL12A1, COL14A1), proteoglycans (DCN, LUM, OGN, ASPN, PRELP), matrix glycoproteins (FBLN1/2/5, SPARC, DPT, THBS2), and elastic-fiber genes (ELN, LOX, LOXL1). \u2022 ECM remodeling: MMP2, MMP11, ADAMTS2, CTSK, LOXL1, LOX indicate active matrix turnover typical of fibrotic myofibroblasts. \u2022 Canonical fibroblast markers: PDGFRA, THY1, MFAP4/5, FBN1, AEBP1, SFRP1/2. \u2022 Contractile/myofibroblast module: ACTA2, TAGLN, MYL9, TPM2, LMOD1, MYLK, CALD1 confer smooth-muscle\u2013like contractility. \u2022 Pericyte/perivascular signatures: PDGFRB, CSPG4, RGS5, NOTCH3, ANGPT1, ABCC9, KCNJ8 support a vessel-associated fibroblast/myofibroblast identity. \u2022 Pro-fibrotic or mesenchymal TFs: SNAI2, TWIST1/2, TCF21, FOXF1, FOXL1 drive fibroblast activation and EMT-like programs. \u2022 Complement/immune ECM cross-talk (C1S, C1R, C3, SERPING1, CFH) is typical of inflamed or tumor stroma. Inconsistencies: \u2022 A few intestine-enriched stromal genes (RSPO3, DCLK1, FOXL1) and neuronal-related genes (NOVA1, MAP1A) appear, but these are occasionally expressed in specialized fibroblast subsets and do not contradict a broad activated fibroblast / myofibroblast state.",

Evidence: \u2022 Extensive positive loading of ribosomal large- and small-subunit genes (e.g., RPL3, RPL10, RPL13A, RPLP0, RPS3, RPS6, RPS18) together with translation elongation factors EEF1A1 and EEF1B2 and chaperones NACA, TPT1 \u2192 classical signature of enhanced ribosome production and bulk protein synthesis. \u2022 Scaffold proteins involved in ribosome function or nascent-chain handling (RACK1/GNB2L1, UBA52, FAU) further support a translational focus. \u2022 Negative loading of ISG15, a canonical interferon-stimulated ubiquitin-like modifier, signifies relative suppression of interferon/antiviral stress pathways, consistent with cells prioritizing growth rather than defense.

Up-regulation of multiple ARP2/3-complex members, small GTPases (RAB, ARF, CDC42), heterotrimeric G-protein subunits, and SNARE/coat proteins together indicate enhanced lamellipodia formation, endocytosis, and exocytosis, whereas the sole negatively loaded gene (JTB) is not essential for these processes. Evidence: \u2022 Actin polymerization & depolymerization \u2013 ACTR2, ARPC4, BRK1 (ARP2/3 complex), CDC42, WDR1, CAP1, CAPZA1, TPM3 support dynamic filament turnover and protrusion formation. \u2022 Vesicle trafficking \u2013 RAB5C (early endosomes), RAB7A (late endosomes/lysosomes), ARF1 (COPI coat), SNAP23 (SNARE), TGOLN2 (trans-Golgi), RTN4 (ER/ER-Golgi), CAPZA1/SLC25A3 cooperation indicate an active endo-/exo-cytic cycle. \u2022 Signal transduction driving motility \u2013 GNB1, GNB2, GNG5 (GPCR \u03b2\u03b3 subunits), YWHAB (14-3-3), MOB1A (Hippo pathway), SKP1/RNF7 (SCF ubiquitin ligase) relay cues that trigger cytoskeletal change. \u2022 Transcriptional/translation machinery support \u2013 PCBP1, HNRNPK, MAX, MTPN, PPP4C suggest increased gene expression needed for remodeling. \u2022 Down-regulation of JTB, a mitochondrial/ER-associated protein not directly tied to motility, is consistent with a shift toward cytoskeletal rather than metabolic functions.

Inconsistencies: \u2022 The module lacks classical EMT transcription factors (e.g., SNAI1, ZEB1) or extracellular-matrix genes (COL1A1, FN1); therefore it represents a generic migration/adhesion program rather than full EMT. \u2022 Inclusion of general translation (EIF4G2, BZW1) and nuclear-transport genes could also reflect heightened proliferation, though most genes point principally to motility.",

Evidence: \u2022 NOTUM, NKD1, APCDD1 \u2013 canonical Wnt target genes whose products dampen Wnt signaling; all are transcriptionally enriched in Lgr5\u207a intestinal stem cells. \u2022 TNFRSF19 (TROY) \u2013 surface receptor highly expressed in crypt stem cells and frequently used as an alternative marker for Lgr5\u207a intestinal stem cells. \u2022 Concordant co-expression of multiple independent Wnt feedback inhibitors (NOTUM, NKD1, APCDD1) indicates a cell population experiencing high Wnt stimulation, characteristic of crypt base stem/progenitors rather than differentiated villus cells. \u2022 COLGALT2 \u2013 although not a classic stem-cell marker, is expressed in rapidly renewing epithelial compartments and supports collagen processing within the stem-cell niche, fitting a crypt environment. Inconsistencies: \u2022 COLGALT2 is also seen in fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells, so its presence is less specific for intestinal stem cells and could reflect stromal contamination or general ECM-related expression.",

        "description": "The gene set most parsimoniously reflects an epithelial / cardiomyocyte-like program centered on desmosome assembly and cortical cytoskeleton organization, with possible engagement of stress- or apoptosis-related signaling. Evidence: \u2022 DSP (Desmoplakin) \u2013 core component of desmosomes; highly expressed in cardiomyocytes and stratified epithelia where strong cell\u2013cell adhesion is required. \u2022 ADD3 (Adducin-\u03b3) \u2013 spectrin\u2013actin\u2013membrane linker that stabilizes the cortical cytoskeleton and works with junctional complexes, complementing DSP-mediated adhesion. \u2022 PAWR (PAR-4) \u2013 stress-induced, pro-apoptotic regulator that is up-regulated in cardiomyocytes and epithelial cells during mechanical or oxidative stress, fitting a \u201cjunction + stress\u201d state. \u2022 ZKSCAN1 \u2013 zinc-finger transcription factor implicated in regulation of cytoskeletal and junctional genes, supporting a transcriptional program that governs adhesion/structure. \u2022 LRBA \u2013 vesicle-trafficking protein involved in recycling of membrane receptors; coherent with the need to shuttle junctional proteins to and from the plasma membrane. Inconsistencies: \u2022 LRBA is best known for roles in immunocytes; its inclusion is compatible but not specific for epithelial or cardiomyocyte states. \u2022 Absence of canonical cardiomyocyte contractile genes (e.g., TNNT2, MYH6) or epithelial keratins leaves some ambiguity between cardiac and general epithelial junction programs.",

Evidence: \u2022 EMP2 \u2013 well-validated surface marker of AT1 cells and a constituent of the canonical AGER/PDPN/EMP2 AT1 signature. \u2022 NFIA and NFIC \u2013 Nuclear Factor I family transcription factors that drive and maintain AT1 fate; loss of NFIA impairs AT1 differentiation in mouse lung. \u2022 BDH2 \u2013 mitochondrial dehydrogenase enriched in the highly oxidative AT1 compartment, fitting the metabolic shift that accompanies AT1 maturation. \u2022 BEX3 \u2013 although first described in neurons, single-cell lung atlases show its up-regulation in AT1 cells and in the AT2\u2192AT1 transitional population, consistent with an AT1-associated program. Inconsistencies: \u2022 BEX3 has broader expression and strong neuronal annotation, so its presence is not uniquely AT1-specific and may signal some off-target or stress-related expression.",

Collectively, concurrent high expression of multiple non-ampliconic Y-chromosome genes is a canonical indicator that the profiled cell originates from a male individual.
